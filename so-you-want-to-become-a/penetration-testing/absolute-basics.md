# Absolute basics

## Let's talk basics

There is no universal and perfectly measured formula, but most penetration testers we talked to agree on the following list of skills as an expected basics of a fellow junior pentester:

* They are versatile in both Windows and Linux (not only using, but also attacking)
* They can read code of a given language&#x20;
* They could write simple scripts&#x20;
* They are familiar with network stack
* They are familiar with OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for web applications
* They can write all the findings as a report

If you feel like you are lacking in one of the areas, we will list a few resources for you to start moving in the right direction.&#x20;

## Getting comfortable with terminal&#x20;

If you never used a Linux terminal in your life, the OverTheWire project could help you to get comfortable with it. It has a nice learning curve and teaches you all the basics. They have several wargames (an offline CTF where you need capture flags to progress), but for the beginners we would recommend their famous Bandit:

If you want the same but to sharpen your PowerShell skills, you might want to look at UnderTheWire:
