# Pentester

## What you need to know&#x20;

We should start with a word about penetration testing being a new industry. In comparison with a more regulated and mature tech industry (meaning you can go to college and get a degree, there are common ways to break into the industry and get a job, etc.) it is a wild west. It's hard to come by two people with identical backgrounds. And it's a good thing if you ask me.

However, materials like this one could help you to grasp the experience of several people to connect the dots in your head.&#x20;

Another disclaimer - penetration testing is not an entry level job by itself. You surely can get a job as a junior pentester, but the bar of all the knowledge you need get before dipping your toes into exploitation side of things is high. There are examples of folks getting a job with no former background other than pentest certifications and courses, but it's a hard way of doing this.&#x20;

Despite what you can read online on that - you don't have to work as a developer or a helpdesk/SOC specialist for X number of years, but if you do, you will help yourself big time. \
A common list of skills that would be a prerequisite for the pentest job are including but not limited to:\
\- programming knowledge (be familiar with at least one language)\
\- be familiar with networks\
\- be familiar with different operation systems, know how they work, and what could go wrong

If you lack any of those skills, you will want to get them first before you move on. &#x20;

## Education

Like it or not, but certificates can help to navigate within such a big industry. There is a list, that you can read as the roadmap:

Look around and check some of them. In general, certificates could give you an idea what you might need to learn next, as most of them will go with the syllabus and explanation of what you can learn in it. Something like OSCP (in the middle of red section of this chart) is a standard among penetration testers.&#x20;

But we are here not to talk about certificates, we are here to talk about knowledge and learning. We could use its syllabus to understand what is expected from you but the end of the course.

OSCP syllabus defines skills that you will:\
\- learn how to perform a penetration test \
\- learn how to write basic scripts\
\- learn where to get and how to modify public exploits\
\- get diverse knowledge in most common application security and web-related vulnerabilities\
\- learn how to navigate within target's infrastructure

This is indeed a crucial skillset for a penetration tester, and you will learn a ton if you take this course, but you don't have to.&#x20;

## Training platforms

There are different resources available online for either free or a symbolic price, which would help you get your skillset up to date and keep it sharp.&#x20;

Penetration testing by itself is a big field, any of its branches could easily be a full-time job. A chance of finding a person being equally experienced in the attacks on the OS kernels and web security vulnerabilities is small, but most professionals would at least be familiar with basics of most common branches, so in these materials we will focus on the basics.&#x20;

TryHackMe and HackTheBox can help you practice all the skills you will need as a penetration tester legally. Their basic features are available for free, but you get more content if you pay for a subscription.&#x20;

There are also a ton of videos on YouTube, articles, and places like Medium, blog posts and such. You just need to identify the area where you are lacking the knowledge and drill into it.&#x20;

As we already mentioned OSCP as a baseline you might want to aim at, there are materials moderated by the community that could help you get there. \


For example, there is a list of the vulnerable machines that you need to be able to crack to make sure you are ready for the exam. Created and curated by Tj\_Null:

There is also a YouTube playlist of ippsec going through the HackTheBox section of it, so you could grasp his methodology and the way of working:
