There are lots of debates about what makes you a professional or makes you eligible to call yourself let's say a developer. Is it a degree that you need in a certain university? Is it the number of years you work in the industry? A certification? Number of stars on GitHub, CVEs under your belt?

We don't know, and in fact it doesn't matter. For simplicity, we will define it as:

> It is the one who can get the job done.

We will stick to this for now. The goal of those learning paths is not to hold your hand along the way anyway, but to provide guidance in the storming sea of the unknown and be a lighthouse. You will need to do all the legwork, do your own research. All we can help with is to provide you with guidance that our practitioners collected over the years of the work in their fields.

If you have worked in your area for quite some time and think you can teach newcomers about certain aspects of your craft, do not hesitate to submit a PR. We are all here to learn.
